To fulfill the requirements mentioned, we can create several classes for the cricket game. Here's an outline of the necessary classes:
1. Player Class
The Player class represents a player in the game. Each player has a name, role (batsman or bowler), and relevant statistics such as runs scored, wickets taken, etc.

public class Player {
    private String name;
    private String role;
    private int runsScored;
    private int wicketsTaken;
    // Other relevant attributes and methods
}
2. Team Class
The Team class represents a team in the cricket game. It contains a list of Player objects representing the players in the team.

import java.util.List;

public class Team {
    private String name;
    private List<Player> players;
    // Other relevant attributes and methods
}
3. CricketGame Class
The CricketGame class represents a cricket game. It has two Team objects representing the two teams playing in the game. The CricketGame class will also contain the match controller logic.

public class CricketGame {
    private Team team1;
    private Team team2;
    // Other relevant attributes and methods
    
    public void playGame() {
        // Logic to control the sequence of random function calls and print the results
    }
}
4. Scoreboard Class
The Scoreboard class is responsible for printing the scoreboard after every match. It will contain information about the overs completed, the batting team, the current batsman, and the runs scored.

public class Scoreboard {
    private int oversDone;
    private Team battingTeam;
    private Player currentBatsman;
    private int runsOnCurrentBall;
    
    public void printScoreboard() {
        // Logic to print the scoreboard
    }
}
5. RandomFunctionHelper Class
The RandomFunctionHelper class contains a method to generate random runs or wickets for each ball.

public class RandomFunctionHelper {
    public static String getRandomOutcome() {
        // Logic to generate random runs or wickets
    }
}
6. DatabaseHelper Class (using JDBC)
The DatabaseHelper class handles the interaction with the database to store and retrieve relevant information about the matches and players.

public class DatabaseHelper {
    // Logic to interact with the database using JDBC
}
7. MatchControllerAPI Class (using Spring)
The MatchControllerAPI class uses Spring framework to expose APIs for starting a match or series, fetching player details, and fetching match details.

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PathVariable;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class MatchControllerAPI {
    @GetMapping("/start-match/{overs}/{matches}")
    public String startMatch(@PathVariable int overs, @PathVariable int matches) {
        // Logic to start a match or series for a given overs and matches
    }
    
    @GetMapping("/player-details/{matchId}/{playerId}")
    public String getPlayerDetails(@PathVariable int matchId, @PathVariable int playerId) {
        // Logic to fetch the details of a player in a given match
    }
    
    @GetMapping("/match-details/{matchId}/{seriesId}")
    public String getMatchDetails(@PathVariable int matchId, @PathVariable int seriesId) {
        // Logic to fetch the details of a given match and series
    }
}
Please note that this is a basic outline of the classes and methods required for the given requirements. You would need to implement the logic inside each class to fulfill the functionality.
