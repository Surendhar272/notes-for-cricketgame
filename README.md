6. ScoreBoard should be printed after every match (should contain overs done, Batting team, batsman, run on curr 
7.  Now make sure each player is defined as BatsMan or Bowler. Modify the random function to returns runs in high

8. Use jdbc for (mySql/mongo/ES/Dynamo) to store relevant info in db. Major part of the task is you have to deci 
   - Minimum requirements : scoreBoard, Match result 
   -  It would be better to store results of players in db also
10. Give db heirarchy some thought and how you should go about implementing it.

11.  Write methods to retrieve said data from db 
Use spring to expose api's for the following 
  - to start a match or series for a given overs and (matches in case of series)  
  - to fetch the the details of a player in a given match  
  - to fetch the details of a given match and series

* Learning outcome :- Spring, Rest API design, MVC pattern *
